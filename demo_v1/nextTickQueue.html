<!--
2. ratechange demo, in itself.
3. comparison ratechange vs toggleTick vs loadOnImg
 * ie9/edge support ratechange, but not toggleTick.
 * ff has a bug with ratechange, but it still works with it
 * chrome works equally well with both, but should use ratechange because it is in the head and even rarer than toggle
 * safari should use loadOnImg..
4. Promise architecture. Is it really better? or is it not? It is better? yes..

<h1>hello sunshine</h1>
two problems:
1. inefficient to createElements again and again, reuse would be more efficient
2. you are not 100% sure that the callbacks are done in the correct order, see the onLoad callbacks in Safari for example.
